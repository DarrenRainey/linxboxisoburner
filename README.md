This program is an easy way to burn xbox isos on Linux.

It is only GUI, which uses growisofs for burning DVD disks (http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/tools/growisofs.c).

Dependencies: Mono (.Net 2.0), Gtk 2.10.3, dvd+rw-tools.

New ideas, suggestions, improvements, criticism and other feedback are welcome!

XGD3 format support is added in version 0.5.0

I don't support piracy! If you copy games with this software, you must have the original and it's for your private use only!
